# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Machine_Learning
Machine Learning Based for Breast Cancer Prediction

The project focuses on extracting data from breast mammograms and applying four different models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Logistic Regression.

To ensure data quality, I implemented data handling techniques such as removing missing values and checking cardinalities and outliers. Additionally, I conducted analytical exploration of the data to gain insights and identify patterns.

In summary, the project consists of the following steps:

Data Extraction: Extracting relevant data from breast mammograms.
Model Selection: Employing four machine learning models - Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-NN, and Logistic Regression - to train and test the data.
Data Handling: Removing missing values and examining cardinalities and outliers in the dataset.
Analytics: Conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and gain insights.

Overall, the purpose of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the nature of breast tumors (benign or malignant) based on the extracted data from mammograms.
